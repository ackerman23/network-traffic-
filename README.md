### Problem Definition


In this notebook, we aim to develop a machine learning model to predict network traffic patterns. The prediction of network traffic is crucial for various aspects of network management and optimization, including resource allocation, capacity planning, performance monitoring, and security enhancement. By accurately forecasting network traffic, companies can proactively address issues, optimize resource utilization, and ensure smooth operation of their network infrastructure.

Predicting network traffic and understanding its patterns can be beneficial for various purposes within a company's network infrastructure management and operation. Here are some potential use cases for the outputs of machine learning models predicting network traffic:


1. Network Capacity Planning: By accurately predicting network traffic rates (such as bytes per second or packets per second), companies can effectively plan and allocate resources to ensure that their network infrastructure can handle current and future demands. This helps in avoiding network congestion and ensuring smooth operation of critical services.

2. Resource Allocation Optimization: Predictions of network traffic characteristics, such as the number of packets or total length of packets, can inform decisions on resource allocation, such as bandwidth provisioning, server capacity planning, and load balancing. This optimization can lead to more efficient resource utilization and cost savings.

3. Performance Monitoring and Troubleshooting: Real-time monitoring of predicted network traffic patterns allows companies to proactively identify performance issues, bottlenecks, and anomalies in their network infrastructure. This enables timely troubleshooting and resolution of issues to minimize downtime and maintain service availability.

4. Security and Anomaly Detection: Predictive analysis of network traffic can help in detecting abnormal or suspicious behavior indicative of security threats, such as network intrusions, malware infections, or denial-of-service attacks. By identifying and mitigating security risks in advance, companies can enhance their cybersecurity posture and protect sensitive data.

5. Capacity Expansion and Scaling: Predictions of future network traffic trends and growth patterns aid in long-term capacity planning and infrastructure scaling. Companies can use these insights to make informed decisions about expanding their network capacity, upgrading hardware, or adopting new technologies to accommodate increasing demands and ensure scalability.

6. Quality of Service (QoS) Management: Understanding predicted network traffic patterns allows companies to prioritize and allocate resources based on service-level agreements (SLAs) or QoS requirements. This ensures that critical applications and services receive sufficient network bandwidth and performance to meet user expectations and business objectives.

7. Optimizing Application Performance: By correlating predicted network traffic with specific applications or services, companies can optimize the performance of their applications by fine-tuning network configurations, optimizing data transfer protocols, or implementing content delivery strategies tailored to the observed traffic patterns.


### Data Overview
This dataset contains 87 features. Each instance holds the information of an IP flow generated by a network device i.e., source and destination IP addresses, ports, interarrival times, layer 7 protocol (application) used on that flow as the class, among others. Most of the attributes are numeric type but there are also nominal types and a date type due to the Timestamp.

The flow statistics (IP addresses, ports, inter-arrival times, etc) were obtained using CICFlowmeter (http://www.unb.ca/cic/research/applications.html - https://github.com/ISCX/CICFlowMeter). The application layer protocol was obtained by performing a DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) processing on the flows with ntopng (https://www.ntop.org/products/traffic-analysis/ntop/ - https://github.com/ntop/ntopng).

### Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning model will be evaluated using [specify evaluation metrics]. Common evaluation metrics for regression tasks include mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R^2). Additionally, [mention any additional evaluation criteria or considerations].
